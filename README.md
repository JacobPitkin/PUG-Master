# PUG-Master
PUG (Pick Up Group) Master is your gaming space admin. Create anonymous discord channels only visible to the creator and anyone the creator shares the room code with.

`/create` to make a text and voice chat with a unique identifier. Share the random 4 character code with anyone you'd like to have access.

`/join <room-code>` will gain you access to the text and voice chat rooms with the unique code provided (as long as it's been created).

`/leave <room-code>` will remove your rights for a room you might have joined, effectively "leaving" those channels.

`/remove <room-code>` will delete the rooms entirely from the server. However, this command can only be executed by the person who created the rooms.



## Looking forward

Should implement timers on the rooms so they only persist a maximum of 24 hours. Unlikely that groups would stay together in this format for 24 hours, and even if they'd like to they have the option of creating new rooms. Maybe also give the option to extend the timer of your rooms.
